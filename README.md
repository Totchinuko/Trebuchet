# Trebuchet
Trebuchet is a Client/Server launcher for Conan Exiles. Made using .net and Avalonia, it uses SteamKit2 to keep server binaries and mod files up to date. The project is still in heavy development, and a lot of planned features are still missing.

Trebuchet is an Open Source project covered by the GNU General Public License version 2. It uses a modified version of Depot Downloader, to simplify the interaction with SteamKit2.  Depot Downloader is also covered by the GNU General Public License version 2, and its modified sources are available in one of my forks, as a submodule of Trebuchet.

Pre-release of the App is currently being tested, we have a semi-private Discord channel to discuss it, instructions are available there too. [Please join the server](<https://discord.gg/fTaxD9SNS9>) and DM to get access.
